## My process

Firs I use the atomic design process to decompose the card in parts that I could visualise being a little part of all together. For example, by the images provide, I divide the whole design in three parts, the background, card and footer.
To the background I added the image, meanwhile the footer was created the have the information about from [where](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/profile-card-component-cfArpWshJ) came the project and [who](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fernando-l-santos/) made, in this case me.
Whit the card, I initially thought about divide in three part, the header background, two sections, where would one contain the photo and personal info about the user, and another with info about his numbers on social media. Although the header and footer of the card did not provide any kind of problem, to place the photo and show presonal info in the card inside the same `div` became a problem, so I decide to separate the photo and the info in two diferent sections.

### Built with
